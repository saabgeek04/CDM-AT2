# Headings and Subheadings

Headings and Suheadings are super important for making it easier for readers to scan through your articles to get to the information they want to see. 

For example, lets say you have an article that explains how a complex system works. This complex system will be broken down into lots of smaller systems, and readers may already understand the way certain systems work and don't want to read about it, prefering to skip to the bits they actually need. This also means that when they skip past something they thought they knew but need to go back and revise, they can do so with ease. 

In conclusion, headings improve accessability and make it easier to navigate your website.
