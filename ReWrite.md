 The Harmful Impact of Racism on Teenagers: Building a Just and Inclusive Future

## Introduction 

This article will explore why its so important for teenagers (like you) to understand the impact of racism on you and your peers, as well as how we need to address the issue to create a better tomorrow.  

## 1. Physcological Impact

There's no real way to sugarcoat it. Racism inflicts significant and possibly long lasting damange on a teenage brain. Racially motivated bullying, sub-subconscious discrimination and prejudice can lead to anxiety, depression and end up with the teenager asscoiating school/uni/tafe with negative feelings.

## 2. Academic Challenges

The aforementioned feelings can severely disrupt a teenager at shool and cause a lack of motivation and discipline, which can send students spiraling. This creates an uneven play field and who knows how many students who could have achieved so much more were screwed over by this.

## 3. Social Isolation

As well as academic challenges, racist actions towards students can cause them to be excluded from friendship groups and end up isolated. This discriminatory behavour can ruin relationships and enable targeted behaviour.

## 4. Development of Prejudices

Exposure to racism as a teenager can reinforce prejudiced attitudes and beliefs. When teenagers witness discriminatory behavior or are subjected to it themselves, they can internalize it. This perpetuates a cycle of discrimination and intolerance, which can carry on into adult life.

## 5. Future Impacts

Racism restricts teenagers' access to opportunities and future prospects. Discrimination can limit access to quality education, employment, and housing, trapping individuals in a cycle of poverty and inequality. By denying teenagers the chance to develop their skills and fulfill their potential, society as a whole suffers the loss of diverse perspectives, talents, and contributions.

## 6. Building an Inclusive Future

To combat the previously dicussed issues on teenagers and their future lives, it is super important to make sure people create a culture of respect, inclusivity and equality. Communities need to actively challenge discriminatory behaviours and promote diversity. If these communities can help people be more empathetic towards others, then it can help significantly with creating an inclusive future

## Conclusion

The harm racism inflicts on teenagers is immeasurable. It can ruin lives and even end them. If we understand the effects racism has on teenagers, we can create a safe environment where everyone is valued and respected, where anybody and everybody can thrive. This creates a brighter and more equitable future for all
